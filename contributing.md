`git-feats` has a dead simple interface for making feats. 

Simply add a feat to the [feats file][feats-file] and it will work in the gem.

If you are looking to contribute, that is a great place to start.

Also, git-feats needs the following:

* Tests (probably RSpec)
* Code Cleanup

Any suggestions are also welcomed with open arms. Please fork, send pull requests and make issues.

#### How to contribute

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
